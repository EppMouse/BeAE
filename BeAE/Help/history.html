<BR>
- 2006 - Removed references to the original name, renamed to BeAE and posted on Berlios.de
<BR>
- 2003 - Released as open source<BR>
<BR>
From BeGroovy: 
"In what ultimately amounts to a mixed fate, Sample Studio by Xentronix has been open sourced, 
after community members paid a $250 source release fee. This was done because Xentronix no 
longer has time to continue work on the product, and didn’t want it to just become abandonware.
So, the downside is that Sample Studio, a potentially great audio editing app for BeOS, has seen 
it’s core developers stop development. The upside is that it is now free software, so it has 
potential to grow quickly if new developers pick it up. "
